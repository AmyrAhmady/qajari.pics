# Qajar Dynasty Photo Gallery Website 

## https://qajari.pics/

### Information
This repo contains source code of https://qajari.pics/ to show 2-24 leaked photos of Qajar Dynasty.  
All of these photos have been leaked from [Golestan Palace](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Golestan_Palace) by an anonymous user taking photos of them and uploading them to Google Drive and sharing a link to them. Original GDrive can be found in here: https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1XVE6EGD8kYnR2G8rR_Dc0JKYi9ykA0vg . They have been gatekept by Iranian authorities and out of access so no one could see how Iran really looked before Pahlavi Dynasty and how Pahlavi shahs (kings) turn Iran into a civil nation.  

**All I want is for people to share it with others.**
